# Folder-weight

Checks how much a folder weighs. Displays the result in bytes and to translate into the necessary information (Megabytes, Gigabytes, etc.)
Divide / multiply depending on the actions by the number - 1024. Slows down a little, depending on the weight of the folder. The program gets tired too, have a conscience!
